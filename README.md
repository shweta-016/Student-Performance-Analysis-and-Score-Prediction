# Student-Performance-Analysis-and-Score-Prediction
Student Performance Analysis and Score Prediction using Machine Learning

This project analyzes student academic data and predicts total performance scores using a Linear Regression model. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand data distribution, detect outliers, and observe relationships between study habits and performance.

The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the model was evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R² score. An Actual vs Predicted plot with a regression line was used to visualize model performance and prediction trends.

Technologies Used: 
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
